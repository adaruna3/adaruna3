Participated in the [DARPA AIE CriticalMAAS program](https://sam.gov/opp/4d53a0f7461e4e51b36495f9d0ec199c/view). I served as a technical lead for the SRI performer team responsible for technical area 3,  "mineral potential mapping exploiting multi-modal fusion". You can learn more about the program [here](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/critical-mineral-assessments-with-ai-support). We published our methodology in multiple conferences including [32nd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3678717.3691268) and [2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10825956/).
