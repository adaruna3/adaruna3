abstract: Robot task execution when situated in real-world environments is fragile. As such, robot architectures must rely on robust error recovery, adding non-trivial complexity to highly-complex robot systems. To handle this complexity in development, we introduce Recovery-Driven Development (RDD), an iterative task scripting process that facilitates rapid task and recovery development by leveraging hierarchical specification, separation of nominal task and recovery development, and situated testing. We validate our approach with our challenge-winning mobile manipulator software architecture developed using RDD for the FetchIt! Challenge at the IEEE 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation. We attribute the success of our system to the level of robustness achieved using RDD, and conclude with lessons learned for developing such systems.

summary: This work introduces Recovery-Driven Development (RDD), an iterative task scripting approach that simplifies the development of robust robot systems by separating task and recovery logic and enabling situated testing. The effectiveness of RDD is demonstrated through its successful application in a challenge-winning mobile manipulator at the IEEE 2019 FetchIt! Challenge.
